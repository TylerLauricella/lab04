## Overview

Program will do some small calculations and return string info, as well as create blobs of random sizes and colors.

## Compiling and Using

Run from Eclipse

## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * It was hard getting the ovals to not overflow.
  * After not getting how to do it by fiddling, I read the instructions very carefully and figured out how to do it.
  * I did not need to use any of the stuff I looked up because it would not have given me the desired result.
  * The biggest error were ovals not being acceptible.
  * Using the relativity of the height and width.
  * The click moment was when I realised what the instructions were saying.
  of working on this project?
  * I cannot think of anything to change.
  
## Testing

I ran the program to make sure that the blobs would not go out of bounds.
